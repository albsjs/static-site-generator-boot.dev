# Static Site Generator (SSG) - Python

This repository contains a custom-built static site generator developed from scratch using Python. The goal of the project was to understand and implement core principles behind performance-optimized static site generators.

I explored Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming concepts to create a tool that processes HTML and Markdown files, generating static sites efficiently.

## Features

- **Markdown to HTML Conversion**: Processes and converts Markdown content into static HTML.
- **Inline & Block Parsing**: Handles inline markdown elements and entire blocks of content.
- **Modular Design**: Built using OOP principles for maintainability and flexibility.

## Project Breakdown

1. **Static Sites**: Built the foundation for processing static HTML and Markdown files.
2. **Nodes**: Developed core HTML generation logic using recursion and OOP.
3. **Inline**: Implemented logic to parse inline markdown elements and generate HTML.
4. **Blocks**: Created functionality to handle larger markdown blocks and convert them to HTML nodes.
5. **Website**: Combined all components to generate and publish a static website.
